# AgentBay

AgentBay is a Bun-managed Next.js App Router app for the Milestone 0 product skeleton. It includes the dashboard-oriented shell, skeleton routes, local Postgres migration tooling, runtime environment validation, and a database-backed `/health` endpoint.

## Requirements

- Bun
- Docker with Docker Compose
- Vercel CLI access for preview deployments

## Install

Install dependencies from the repository root:

```bash
bun install
```

## Environment

Local and deployment environments must define:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://agentbay:agentbay@127.0.0.1:54329/agentbay
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Use `.env.example` as the local template. `DATABASE_URL` must use `postgres://` or `postgresql://`; `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` must use `http://` or `https://`. Secret values, production database URLs, Vercel tokens, and generated `.env.local` files must stay out of commits.

## Local Database

Start the local Postgres service:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
```

Apply infrastructure migrations:

```bash
bun run db:migrate
```

Check database-backed health from the command line:

```bash
bun run db:health
```

The local default database URL is:

```text
postgres://agentbay:agentbay@127.0.0.1:54329/agentbay
```

The migration set is infrastructure-only for Milestone 0. It does not create agent, event, log, approval, runner, billing, auth, Hermes, Telegram, or provider domain tables.

## Development Server

Run the development server after the database is available and migrations have run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open these route smoke targets locally:

- `http://localhost:3000/`
- `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
- `http://localhost:3000/agents`
- `http://localhost:3000/agents/test-agent`
- `http://localhost:3000/settings`
- `http://localhost:3000/health`

`/health` returns 2xx JSON only when the app can reach the configured database. It returns non-2xx JSON when `DATABASE_URL` is missing, malformed, or points to an unavailable database.

## Quality Gates

Run individual gates when isolating failures:

```bash
bun run format:check
bun run lint
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run build
bun run test:e2e
```

Run the aggregate gate before handoff or deployment:

```bash
bun run verify
```

The Playwright E2E suite starts the Next.js dev server and smoke-tests the Milestone 0 routes on desktop and mobile Chromium profiles. It expects a reachable database for `/health`, so run:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
bun run db:migrate
bun run test:e2e
```

## Vercel Preview Deployment

The initial empty-app preview from issue #6 was deployed from the authenticated local Vercel CLI account `ametel01` to scope `ametel01s-projects` and project `agentbay`.

Initial preview URL:

```text
https://agentbay-9wi2xvhbh-ametel01s-projects.vercel.app
```

For the completed Milestone 0 app, validate local gates first:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
bun run db:migrate
bun run db:health
bun run verify
```

Then link this checkout if needed:

```bash
vercel link --project agentbay --scope ametel01s-projects -y
```

Run an explicit preview deployment:

```bash
vercel deploy -y --no-wait --target preview --scope ametel01s-projects
```

The Vercel deployment environment must provide:

```text
DATABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
```

`DATABASE_URL` should be a Vercel-accessible Postgres connection string, not the local Docker URL. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` should be the preview or production app URL used by that deployment. If the CLI has no credentials or Vercel lacks required env vars, record the exact blocker in `PROGRESS.md`.

The Vercel CLI creates local `.vercel/` metadata and may create `.env.local` for local credentials. Both are ignored and should remain local-only.

## Milestone 0 Acceptance

Milestone 0 is complete when:

- The app scaffold, TypeScript, formatter, linting, tests, build, and deployment path are present.
- `PROGRESS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` exist and follow the tracking rules.
- `/dashboard`, `/agents`, `/agents/:agentId`, `/settings`, and `/health` render locally.
- Dashboard, agents, agent detail, and settings pages remain skeleton-only with no fake agent records or lifecycle actions.
- Local Postgres starts, migrations run, and `/health` reports success only when the database is reachable.
- `.env.example` documents every required local/deploy variable without secrets.
- `bun run format:check`, `bun run lint`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run test`, `bun run build`, `bun run test:e2e`, and `bun run verify` pass.
- A final completed-app Vercel preview URL is recorded in `PROGRESS.md`, or the exact external credential/environment blocker is recorded there.

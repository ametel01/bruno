## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial AgentBay root app page that points users toward the future `/dashboard` route.
- Database-backed `/health` endpoint and local Postgres migration tooling for operator checks.
- AgentBay product shell and skeleton routes for `/`, `/dashboard`, `/agents`, `/agents/:agentId`, and `/settings`, with empty states and placeholder-only settings surfaces.
- Milestone 1 Postgres schema migration for `users`, `agents`, `agent_events`, and the `agent_status` enum without enabling agent creation or lifecycle behavior.
- `POST /api/agents` for validated transactional creation of stopped persistent agents and matching `agent.created` events.
